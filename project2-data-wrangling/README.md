# Segregation Report
This is a written report investigating the levels of segregation in 14 US cities using data at the census tract level. This is achieved by computing 3 metrics of segregation from the U.S. Census Bureau, thoughtfully comparing the cities based on these metrics, and proposing an alternative formula for estimating segregation.
