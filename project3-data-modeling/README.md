# Soccer Referee Modeling
This paper and analysis investigates multiple approaches to answering the question *"do referees give more red-cards to soccer players with darker skin-tones?"* This also invesigates how analysts who approach the same problem in different ways [produce different results](https://psyarxiv.com/qkwst/)


Along with extending the study, we aim to assess two research questions:
1. Are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light skin toned players?     
2. Are soccer referees from countries high in skin-tone prejudice more likely to award red cards to dark skin toned players?
