# Projects from INFO 370: Core Methods in Data Science

Surveys the major topics within data science, including data ingestion, cloud computing, statistical inference, machine learning, information visualization, and data ethics.

## Projects

### Project 1: Song Lyrics Web Scraper // web scraping

This project is a simple web scraper library to collect and process song lyrics from lyrics.com.


### Project 2: Segregation Report // data wrangling

Written report investigating the levels of segregation in 14 US cities using data at the census tract level. This is achieved by computing 3 metrics of segregation from the U.S. Census Bureau, thoughtfully comparing the cities based on these metrics, and proposing an alternative formula for estimating segregation.


### Project 3: Soccer Referee Modeling // data modeling

This paper and analysis investigates multiple approaches to answering the question *"do referees give more red-cards to soccer players with darker skin-tones?*. This also invesigates how analysts who approach the same problem in different ways [produce different results](https://psyarxiv.com/qkwst/).


### Project 4: Predicting Poverty // machine learning

This project attempts to create efficient pipelines for measuring, tracking, and predicting poverty for this [DrivenData competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/50/worldbank-poverty-prediction/). I explore multiple algorithms to predict household-level poverty status using surveys data from three developing countries, each with a different distribution of wealth


### Project 5: BigMart Sales Prediction // final project

BigMart has amassed a large set of data from their existing outlet stores and has publicized them for the purpose of machine learning. Identifying key features of stores can enable for effective outlet management of items and assist in solidifying sales tactics. We first conducted exploratory data analysis to identify areas of interest within the data as well as linear regression with a selected set of features. Thereafter receiving our results of the linear regression, we turned to various machine learning algorithms before finalizing on with a simple linear regression model.
